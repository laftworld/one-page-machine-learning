Once upon a long, long time ago, people were stupid. They just got wet in the rain, for example. But one day, someone decided they didn’t want to be wet anymore, so they decided to invent tools. Of course, all the tools were built manually and used manually.

After several million years later, people got smarter and invented something called a machine. People who were called ‘engineers’ made the machines and lazy people like me just used them by pushing the run button (AD 1956 is the year the term ‘AI’ was born). The machines were built based on logic (i.e., if~then~), and many engineers needed to debug the machines before selling them to customers, to check if they had logical errors or not.

After several decades, people got smarter and invented a new type of machine which is even smarter. We still need engineers to build such machines and set compulsory parameters for them. However, the machines now investigate given a training set of data and tune their own values. This is called machine ‘learning’. This means the machines change settings in themselves by learning from data. The machines are still based on logic, and also are based on data to be built. This is a big difference because machines in the past were stupid, so they could not correct themselves without engineers. However, engineers still need to check whether the machines are well made or not. The checking is done by putting other sets of data called validation and testing.

After more long, long years, when utopia comes, both building and running procedures might be automated (I believe), and then we may not need engineers anymore.
